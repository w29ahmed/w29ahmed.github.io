Resumes are great and all, but I dislike being limited to one page. My aim with this site was to break free from that constraint and provide a larger portfolio of all my professional and personal projects!

### Built with
* React
* TypeScript
* Bootstrap for responsive layout and as a React component library
* Icons from Font Awesome
* Sass for cleaner CSS and to efficiently style light and dark themes ([Tutorial](https://medium.com/@katiemctigue/how-to-create-a-dark-mode-in-sass-609f131a3995))

### Inspiration
Throughout development, I referred to various other personal sites for design inspiration as well as to dig into some source code to see how certain features were implemented. Below are the sites that I ended up borrowing ideas from:
* [Katie McTigue](https://kaitlinmctigue.github.io/#/)
* [Connor Barker](https://connorbarker.com/)
* [Jose Mari Ponce](https://ecnop.dev/#/main)

Thank you to the authors of those sites, I encourage you to check them out!
